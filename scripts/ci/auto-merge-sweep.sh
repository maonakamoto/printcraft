#
# Merge every open PR that is ready and fully green, then re-arm CI/CD.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Nobody reviews PRs on this fleet — the owner explicitly does not want to be in
# the merge loop, and background-job agent sessions are barred from merging by
# hand. So the policy lives here, in the repo, where it is visible, revocable,
# and applies uniformly to every PR instead of depending on who opened it.
#
# THE POLICY
#   merge a PR  <=>  it is not a draft
#                    AND carries no hold label
#                    AND has at least one check
#                    AND every check has finished green
#                    AND GitHub reports it cleanly mergeable
#
# Anything else is left alone for the next sweep. Nothing here forces a merge:
# a red or pending PR simply waits, and a draft waits forever. To hold a ready
# PR back, mark it a draft or add one of the hold labels below.
#
# ONE PR PER SWEEP, OLDEST FIRST, AND ONLY ONTO A GREEN BASE
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# A PR's checks prove *that PR against the base it branched from* — not against
# the other PRs sitting next to it. Merging a batch in one pass would put a
# combination onto the base that nothing ever built. So this script merges at
# most one PR, then hands control back to CI: the merge train advances one car
# per sweep, and every car is verified on the base before the next one couples.
#
# For the same reason it refuses to merge while the base's CI is red or still
# running. Red base => stop adding changes until it is fixed; running CI => the
# answer is not in yet. Both simply defer to the next sweep.
#
# THE RE-ARM (do not remove)
#   A push made with the default GITHUB_TOKEN does NOT trigger workflows. Both
#   CI and the deploy workflow here run on push, so a merge from this script
#   would otherwise land on the base branch and never build or ship. Worse, the
#   green-base guard above keys on "a CI run exists for the current tip" — with
#   no CI run ever produced by an automated merge, the very next sweep would
#   block forever. The explicit workflow_dispatch calls at the end restore both.
#
#   REARM_WORKFLOWS is set by .github/workflows/auto-merge.yml and lists exactly
#   the workflows that would otherwise have fired on push.
